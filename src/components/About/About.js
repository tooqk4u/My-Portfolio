            I am a full stack developer with a background in translation,
            working cross culturally in the South Pacific. I have a M.A. degree
            with a certificate in linguistics. I have recently obtained a
            certificate in full stack development from Vanderbilt University.

            My work as a linguist required creative problem-solving skills and a
            focus on consumer impact. I have experience managing multiple
            projects and teams. I work hard and strive for excellence in
            everything that I do. These same skills serve me well when it comes
            to meeting client expectations for their web needs.

            When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking,
            fishing, gaming, and practicing martial arts.
